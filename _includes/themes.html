            <p class=brief>
                One great way to preserve your memories is to make sure you’re not the only one who’s got them. 
                By sharing your story with others, you’re adding another measure of security — 
                and you’re giving your loved ones a chance to get to know you better. 
                As we mentioned, social media can be a great way to do this, but how you choose to share your memories is up to you.
